# MPEG_encoder
The project aims to create an efficient encoder that converts JPEG images into a video file, prioritizing both a higher ratio of images to encoded file size and higher speed for encoding and decoding. The encoder will take multiple JPEGs (up to 100 or more) with the same dimensions and combine them into a single, compact video file while maximizing compression efficiency and processing speed. Playback will be smooth, displaying at least 10 images per second (10 fps). The final synthesized video file adopts the MPEG1 standard.


Other features of this encoder include a command-line interface (CLI) for encoding and viewing images, as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting and organizing files, applying real-time video effects, and controlling playback, and an Android client which enables an Android device play the MPEG1 video.
